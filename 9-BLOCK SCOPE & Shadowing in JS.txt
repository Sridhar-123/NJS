What is Block in JS?
{ }// Block combining multiple js statements
{
    // Compound statements
    var a=10;
    console.log(a);
}
We group multiple statements in a Block ,where we can use it when javascript expects one statement

{
   const a=10;
   let b=2;
   var b=3;
   // const and let are Block scoped because they are made in the another memory
   but var is in global executive memory so it is globally scoped
}

what is shadowing in JS?
var a=100;
{
    var a=10; this a shadowed the upper a value (100) so it removes 100 and keep in the memory location of a as 10 
    console.log(a);//10
}
console.log(a);//10

let b=100;
{
    var a=1;
    let b=10;
    const c=10;
    console.log(b); // 10
}
console.log(b); // 100
here in script b=100
here in Block b=10 this b shadowed 100 and gave 10
global in a=1; 

we cannot use let over var
let a=9;
{
    var a=9; // this is termed as illegal shadowing
}
but its vicce versa js accepts it
var a=9;
{
    let a=9;// no error
}
